Description: The package implements estimation of average treatment effects (ATE) of point interventions on time-to-event outcomes with K competing risks (K can be 1). The method uses propensity scores weighting for emulation of baseline randomization, which is described in Charpignon et al. (2022) <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-35157-w>.

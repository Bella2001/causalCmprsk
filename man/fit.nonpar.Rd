\arguments{
\item{df}{a data frame that includes time-to-event \code{X}, type of event \code{E},
a treatment indicator \code{A}  and covariates \code{C}.}

\item{X}{a character string specifying the name of the time-to-event variable in \code{df}.}

\item{E}{a character string specifying the name of the "event type" variable in \code{df}.}

\item{trt.formula}{a formula expression, of the form \code{response ~ predictors}.
The \code{response} is a binary treatment/exposure variable,
for which a logistic regression model (a  Propensity Scores model) will be fit using \code{glm}.
See the documentation of \code{glm} and \code{formula} for details. As an alternative to specifying \code{formula},
arguments \code{A} and \code{C}, defined below, can be specified.
Either \code{formula} or a pair of \code{A} and \code{C} must be specified.}

\item{A}{a character specifying the name of the treatment/exposure variable.
It is assumed that \code{A} is a numeric binary indicator with 0/1 values, where \code{A}=1
is assumed a treatment group, and \code{A}=0 a control group.}

\item{C}{a vector of character strings with variable names (potential confounders)
in the logistic regression model for Propensity Scores, i.e. P(A=1|C=c).
The default value of \code{C} is NULL corresponding to \code{wtype}="unadj"
that will estimate treatment effects in the raw (observed) data.}

\item{wtype}{a character string variable indicating the type of weights that will define the target
population for which the ATE will be estimated.
The default is "unadj" - this will not adjust for possible
treatment selection bias and will not use propensity scores weighting. It can be used, for example,
in data from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) where there is no need for emulation of baseline randomization.
Other possible values are "stab.ATE", "ATE", "ATT", "ATC" and "overlap".
See Table 1 from Li, Morgan, and Zaslavsky (2018).
"stab.ATE" is defined as P(A=a)/P(A=a|C=c) - see Hern√°n et al. (2000).}

\item{cens}{an integer value in \code{E} that corresponds to censoring times recorded in \code{X}.
By default \code{fit.nonpar} assumes \code{cens}=0}

\item{conf.level}{the confidence level that will be used in the bootstrap confidence intervals.
The default is 0.95}

\item{bs}{a logical flag indicating whether to perform bootstrap in order to obtain confidence intervals. There are no
analytical confidence intervals in \code{fit.nonpar}}

\item{nbs.rep}{number of bootstrap replications}

\item{seed}{the random seed for the bootstrap, in order to make the results reproducible}

\item{parallel}{a logical flag indicating whether to perform bootstrap sequentially or in parallel,
using several cores simultaneously. The default value is FALSE. In parallel execution, the number
of available cores is detected, and the parallel jobs are assigned to the number of
detected available cores minus one.}

\item{verbose}{a logical flag indicating whether to show a progress of bootstrap.
The progress bar is shown only for sequential bootstrap computation.
The default value is FALSE.}

\description{
Implements nonparametric estimation (based on the weighted Aalen-Johansen estimator) of ATE meaning that
it does not assume any model for potential outcomes.
It provides three measures of treatment effects on time-to-event outcomes:
(1) cause-specific hazard ratios which are time-dependent measures under a nonparametric model,
(2) risk-based measures such as cause-specific risk differences and cause-specific risk ratios, and
(3) restricted-mean-time differences which quantify how much time on average was lost (or gained)
due to treatment by some specified time point.
Please see our package vignette for more details.
